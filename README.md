# Reptar Theme: Breeze
### In progress.
A minimalistic structured Twitter-like theme for Reptar, a static site generator built with Node JS.  

Theme demo: http://reptar-theme-breeze.netlify.com/  

#### Features  
* Code highlighting.  
* Responsive design.  
* Sitemap.  
* Good content structure.  

#### How to use  
1. [Get Reptar](http://reptar.github.io/docs/installation/).
2. Init a new Reptar project.
3. Clone this repository to another folder.
4. Replace your current files/folders with the one's from this repo.  
  * Replace: `_config.yml`  
  * Replace: `package.json`  
  * Replace: `_themes`  
  * Add: `_content`  

The `_content` folder is unique to this theme. It lets us save all of our posts and pages into a logical structure. Maybe some time in the future Reptar will have this by default (fingers crossed).  

After you've done this it should work to use the `reptar watch` or `reptar build` + `reptar serve` commands in your terminal.
